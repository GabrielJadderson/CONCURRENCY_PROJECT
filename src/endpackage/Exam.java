     * This method recursively visits a directory to find all the text files contained in it and its subdirectories.

     * You should consider only files ending with a .txt suffix. You are guaranteed that they will be text files.
     * <p>
     * You can assume that each text file contains a (non-empty) comma-separated sequence of
     * (positive) numbers. For example: 100,200,34,25
     * There won't be any new lines, spaces, etc., and the sequence never ends with a comma.
     * <p>
     * The search is recursive: if the directory contains subdirectories,
     * these are also searched and so on so forth (until there are no more
     * subdirectories).
     * <p>
     * This method returns a list of results. The list contains a result for each text file that you find.
     * Each {@link Result} stores the path of its text file, and the highest number (maximum) found inside of the text file.
     *
     * @param dir the directory to search
     * @return a list of results ({@link Result}), each giving the highest number found in a file
